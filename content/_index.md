Hi there! This is Kai.

I'm a Software Development Engineer working at Amazon. I earned my master's degree from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University. I love solving problems by devising efficient algorithms and software. I've delivered a variety of projects, from which I've gained a solid foundation in software engineering. 

Please reach out at [kaiwhu@gmail.com](mailto:kaiwhu@gmail.com) if you're interested in learning more about me or just have a good joke.
